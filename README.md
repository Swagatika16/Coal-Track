# Digital Platform for Multi Modal Transportation Visualization

<!-- ![Coal Mine Visualization](insert-image-url-here) -->

This GitHub repository contains the code and resources for a 3D web visualization project that showcases the transportation of coal from mines in India using sensor data from inside the mines and GPS information from vehicles. The project utilizes various technologies such as React, Blender, MongoDB, and Google Cloud Platform to create an interactive and informative visualization of coal transportation routes.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to provide a visual representation of the entire coal transportation process within India's coal mines. It integrates real-time sensor data collected from inside the mines with GPS information from the vehicles used for transportation. Users can explore and analyze coal transportation routes, monitor vehicle movements, and gain insights into the mining operation's efficiency.

## Features

- Interactive 3D visualization of coal mine transportation.
- Real-time updates from sensors within the mines.
- GPS tracking of coal transportation vehicles.
- Highlighted routes for coal transportation.


## Technologies Used

- **React**: Used to build the interactive web interface and user interactions.
- **Blender**: Utilized for 3D modeling and visualization of coal mines and transportation routes.
- **MongoDB**: Provides a NoSQL database for storing and retrieving sensor data.


## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Swagatika16/Coal-Track
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

4. Access the web application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Data Sources

- **Sensor Data**: The sensor data inside the mines is collected using IoT devices and stored in MongoDB for real-time access.
- **GPS Data**: GPS information from coal transportation vehicles is collected and integrated into the visualization.
